# Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge

Project demonstrates the following:
1. Strong understanding of Neural Networks and parameter optimization - both conceptually and in practice.
2. Strong mastery of Machine Learning concepts and mathematical principles - with the ability to properly apply different concepts to derive unique solutions.
3. Ability to conceptualize and find innovative solutions

The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge, hosted on AIcrowd, was to create an automatic playlist continuation program - which when given a seed track or list of seed tracks, the algorithm could predict the subsequent tracks in the playlist. 

This page consists of the report (with a hypothetical business case) aswell as the project code.
